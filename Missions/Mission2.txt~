Sketchy Sam: "So did you get any info from Los Rochos?"
You:"Nah dawg, nothing important... Just that I had something they wanted.
Sketchy Sam:"Dang homie.... what did you do?
You:"Man I don't have anything, I ain't got no money, live in some ghetto home, and live off of drugs and alcohol.

*A black van approaches you and everything goes black
*You wake up later tied to a chair
*You think to yourself, this some cray @$#% I got myself into... well better escape! 
*You manage to break the cheap wooden chair and escape.
