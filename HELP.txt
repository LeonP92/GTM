Welcome to Grand Theft Manual!

This game is a text- based spin off of the popular and controversial game Grand Theft Auto.

To beat the game you have to complete all the missions.

You can do anything in between including robberies to get more money and picking fights to get more money and increase in levels. 

When you increase in level you will get more HP and your opponents will give more money if you beat them.

You can use your gold to buy new weapons, the higher your level the better weapons you can buy. 

Getting into too many fights and robberries will increase your notority. If this happens you will be chased down by the police... You won't beat them... maybe.

The missions are generally a series of fights, with increasing difficulty. You will not be able to rest in your fights so be prepared to fight until you die.

It's your life in GTM you can do whatever you want! You should try the story line out by beating the missions. 

HAVE FUN!
