description: this will be a command line driven, text based version of
	the famous game, Grand Theft Auto. The user will enter commands
	in the form of words, like "shoot", "punch", "move", "buy", etc.
	We may also implement a graphical featrue taht would display 
	a small map for the user to walk around in where npc's will be 
	spawned depending on differnt situations.
