Leon them all as of 4/25/2013 nigguhs
Grant:
	Trying to continue when nothing in file, tries to parse("name") and freaks the sh** out
	
	Sometimes when starting, Lady Girl Picture skips all over the place, like spacing on my computer

	Main Menu: Does not recognize 4 and Quit, Takes me to some weird place and messes up

	Upper case Stranger - I redid fight function to take fight(fighter,hlt1=100,hlt2=120) to elimate code, so whenvever that is called, should be fight("Stranger", OPTIONAL hlt) 

Leon:
	When testing please test steal in shop.... beating the clerk should be really fucking hard. but if you do so you get an item. Then
	then if you run away you get no items
********Clerk is hard to beat, but still getting items if I run ********during fight - Eric
