Grand Theft Manual: A text based game

This game is meant to be a spin off of Grand Theft Auto but more structured in the story line department.
You can almost do anything you want but there are limits.

Basic Story Line: You're a thug who got on the wrong side of some gang feud. You got hit and not knowing who attacked you, you have to go through and 
get revenge, because you know you're a thug and thats what you do. Go through the missions to finish the game. Pick fights for experience and money. You can also rob stuff to get money and buy better items. You better get some good gear if you want to go up against the biggest boss of the biggest gangs in the city...


Good luck. Thug 4 Lyfe.
