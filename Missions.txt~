Stranger: Hey... Hey man... You're the guy the gangs beat up! I'm surprised you're alive!
You: What?! Who are you?! Tell me!
Sketchy Sam: Easy there big boy... I'm Sketchy Sam, the source of all your information on the streets if you need me.
You: Well start talking! Tell me what you know!
Sketchy Sam: Geez, I can see why the gangs beat you up with that big mouth of yours. Alright fine listen carefully. In this region there are a couple of ruling gangs man... You must've gotten on one of their nerves cause I just heard rumors that they gathered all their men to beat up just one person... you.
You: Hah, what I did isn't important, but those bastards took me by surprise... I don't even know which gang got me.
Sketchy Sam: Man, I don't know I just heard it was one of the big ones around here... maybe one of the smaller gangs have some info on it
You: Well... direct me Sketch Sam... where should I start?
Sketchy Sam: Well you can try to hunt down the Los Rochos.. they probably know something... you'll have to sneak into their base and beat up their leader, Tank Sartov, though... Chances are you'll have to plow through a bunch of their men....
You: Hah... well that's no problem as long as no one hits me over the head again. 

........................................Mission 1...............................................
