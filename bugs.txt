from fight menu on first boss, can not select options 'i' or 'I'

had one game going, and died on first boss. started new game, stole a rifle, beat clerk. After defeating clerk, it went thorugh some dialogue that plays after beating first boss, and said "congrats man, you beat mission 1" -- After pressing any key to continue, Los Rochos Boss started fighting me (he had 130 health, not sure what he starts with) - I didnt have the pistol i had from the last game, but i did have the newly stolen rifle. After beating the boss, game proceeded as normal
