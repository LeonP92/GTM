Welcome to Grand Theft Manual!

This game is a text- based spin off of the popular and controversial game Grand Theft Auto

To beat the game you have to complete all the missions. Be weary though you should be a certain level to beat the missions or else it'd be very hard... You can't rest when you're in the mission. Missions will require you to fight three scrubs and one boss. If you die you will lose a certain percentage of your gold and experience, so try not to die. 

SUGGESTED LEVELS FOR MISSIONS:
Mission 1 - Level 3 or level 4
Mission  2 - Level 6
Mission 3 - Level 7 or level 8
Mission 4 - Level 9
You get the idea...

You can do anything in between including robberies to get more money and picking fights to get more money and increase in levels. 

When you increase in level you will get more HP and your opponents will give more money if you beat them.

You can use your gold to buy new weapons, you will definitely need the best weapons to take on the biggest and baddest. 

You'll need to fight and rob to get far in this hood. Don't worry about the cops they're all gangsters in this town.

It's your life in GTM you can do whatever you want! You should try the story line out by beating the missions. 

HAVE FUN!
